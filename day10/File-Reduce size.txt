üì¶ Flutter App Size Reduce Karva na Effective Tips
1Ô∏è‚É£ Use --split-per-abi (for APK)
Avoid shipping unnecessary native binaries (like x86 if you only need arm64).

bash
Copy
Edit
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
‚Üí Aa command thi alag-alag APK generate thase (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64)
‚Üí Play Store automatically selects correct one

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use AAB Instead of APK
AAB (Android App Bundle) generates optimized APKs for each device:

bash
Copy
Edit
flutter build appbundle
‚úÖ Recommended for Play Store uploads ‚Äî size drastically reduces!

3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Unused Resources
Delete unnecessary images, fonts, and assets.

Use flutter_launcher_icons carefully ‚Äî keep icon sizes optimized.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Minimize Dependencies
Use only required packages from pubspec.yaml.

Remove unused packages.

Prefer lightweight libraries (e.g., use http instead of bigger network packages unless needed).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Tree Shaking (for Dart Code)
Flutter automatically does this in release builds.

bash
Copy
Edit
flutter build apk --release
‚úÖ Removes unused Dart code from final binary

6Ô∏è‚É£ Compress Image Assets
Use tools like:

tinypng.com

imagecompressor.com

Also prefer:

.webp instead of .png (smaller and supported)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Use Proguard (for Android)
For native and Kotlin/Java code optimization:

In android/app/build.gradle, enable it:

gradle
Copy
Edit
buildTypes {
    release {
        shrinkResources true
        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(
            'proguard-android-optimize.txt'),
            'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
8Ô∏è‚É£ Lazy Load or Cache Network Images
Use packages like cached_network_image or load assets conditionally.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Defer features using deferred imports
If you have heavy screens used occasionally, use deferred import to load them only when needed.

dart
Copy
Edit
import 'package:my_heavy_screen.dart' deferred as heavy;
üîç Bonus Tip: Analyze App Size
bash
Copy
Edit
flutter build apk --analyze-size
It generates a .json and .html report to see what's taking space in your app.
